                    My name is Michael Nos and I'm 21 years old. I'm currently a student at University of New Hampshire's coding 
                    bootcamp. My goal is to get a job as a software developer and I plan on reaching that goal by going 
                    through the coding bootcamps curriculum and supplementing it with outside resources.

                    Some random facts about myself are that I like to go hiking and mountain biking. My personality type is 
                    an INFJ. Pretty much everything about that type matches who I am. One of my biggest accomplishments
                    is getting a Black Belt in Tae Kwon Do and I'm interested in trying another martial art like Brazilian Jiu Jitsu in the future.

                    Some of my end goals are finding a job in a big tech company in a popular tech area. I'd also like to
                    become proficient enough with programming so I can help teach/tutor people entering the field.
